Good morning all researchers!

I am Asst. Prof. Dr. Rujira Ouncharoen, Dean of ICDI CMU.

ICDI warmly welcomes all scholars coming from around the world, as well as all students and friends from CMU and local communities.

The relationship between technology and the economy and society is a dynamic one. Technological innovation, especially digital innovation, creates the foundation for the new society and economy. In turn, the economy serves as a container for the technology, and the economy's structure and society operations evolve alongside the changes brought about by new technologies.

It is our honor to be a co-host for this distinguished meeting organized by INS CAA to discuss the intersection of technology and society. We extend our gratitude to the organizers: GCC, CMBUA, and 4seas, for their hard work in putting together this important academic event.

Please enjoy the discussions and presentations during this event.

Thank you!
